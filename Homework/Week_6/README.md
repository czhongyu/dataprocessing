# Week_6: D3 Linked Views

The datamaps example on the site only works with version 3 of D3. Because we work with version 5 in this course, you can not use it here. An alternative that works with version 4 can be found here: http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/8e15870eb432a21f0bc4d3d527b2d14f This code can largely be taken over, but you can link the map to another, your own dataset (not to the population size) ). In addition, you should pay attention to two things to get your card working for version 5:
1. Loading multiple files to d3 (the part under 'queue ()' in the example) now works differently in version 5. Look again at your code from last week (hint: "Promise").
2. The example uses a file "world_countries.json", where it is not clear where this file actually comes from. This file can be found here: http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/raw/8e15870eb432a21f0bc4d3d527b2d14f/a45e8709648cafbbf01c78c76dfa53e31087e713/world_countries.json
