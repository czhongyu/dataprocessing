## Feedback

I like your visualization with a double y-axis, one point to note would be that it would be better if your second y-axis would range from 0 through 10, as the visual differences between movies would be more fair than in the current situation.

An excellent assignment! Some small pointers would be that in Python spaces are usually not put around keyword arguments in function calls (such as `class_` in `movie.find()`, and you could have used `writer.writerows()` to save you a loop in `save_csv`.

An excellent assignment! All output is correct, and the JSON is valid. I like the extra touch of producing a regression with  1 / infant mortality, which produces a better image than a regression purely based on GDP vs Infant Mortality. 

As a point for improvement, try to use more functions. I do like the `get_number` function using regex, but there is still a lot of code in the main, which could have been split over several functions.

Your output looks nice, it is a complete graph! I like the additions of the minimum and maximum of your dataset. As some points of feedback for future assignments, it is preferable for your JavaScript to be in it's own `.js` files, rather than being writtin in the HTML file. You could have also made more use of functions, to distribute your code into more manageable chunks.

Your GitHub Pages is rather starting to look like a portfolio, well done! I appreciate the professional-look of it. Regarding your code, your HTML is excellently structured and the division of your JS into multiple external files is really nice as well. 

As some minor feedback points to improve your code, it is more clean to delete commented out code before submitting your assignment. Also, every file of code which you have written (HTML, CSS and JS) should start with a comment telling the reader who wrote the code and the function of that file.

Other than that, an excellent assignment!

Really impressive work, once again! The extra interactions on this page would make it worthy of being included alongside an online news article or something along those lines, very nice! Using the Bootstrap grid system is a nice touch, for the responsiveness and overall layout of your website!

Your assignment looks nice! I like the story aspect, as well as the transition on the pie chart. The time slider is a nice touch as well!

As some points of feedback to improve:

* You could be a bit more strict in the casing of your variable names and functions
* The function `usedata()` does not really seem to fulfill any purpose
* In the case of making the piechart, you have a for loop about the `pielist` variable. In this occasion, you have written your own for loop, but you could have used the `data()` method of D3
